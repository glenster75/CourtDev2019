CourtDev 2019 LA Workshop

## Dependencies:
* Dotnet Core 2.2:
    * https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
    * Download and install both SDK and Runtime
    * If you already have a different version installed it’s OK, go ahead and install version 2.2 as well. They work in parallel just fine
* A text editor of your choice:
    * If you don’t already have a favorite I recommend Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
* Node:
    * https://nodejs.org/en/
    * I recommend downloading the latest version 11.10.0
* NPM:
    * If you already had node installed make sure you have the latest NPM version by typing the following in your terminal:
    > npm i -g npm
* The latest version of Angular CLI:
    * Type the following in your terminal:
    > npm i -g @angular/cli
